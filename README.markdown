django-maid
=======================

Your app's a mess, but the Django maid can help! Django maid gets rid of
files that have been orphanedâ€”either because their models have been deleted or
because they've been replaced with newer versions. No more messy media
directories while the django maid's on the job!

Installation
------------

1. `pip install -e git+https://github.com/matthewwithanm/django-maid.git#egg=django-maid`
2. Add `maid` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in settings.py.

Usage
--------

    from myapp.models import MyModel
    import maid
    
    maid.register_file_fields(MyModel, 'document', 'thumbnail_image')


Maid will now automatically delete files stored in the `document` and
`thumbnail_image` properties of `MyModel` when they're orphaned.

Warning
--------

If you have a non-standard setup where files are shared between different
models, you should manage the deletion of files yourself. Django-maid can't
tell that the file is being used somewhere else, so she might throw out
something that you didn't want her to.
